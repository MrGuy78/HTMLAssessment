	<h1>Vikings</h1>
	<h2>Franchise Founded</h2>
	<p>Minnesota was granted an NFL franchise at the league Owners Meetings in Miami on Jan. 28, 1960. The team began play in 1961. The founding group consisted of Max Winter, E. William Boyer, H.P. Skoglund, Ole Haugsrud and Bernard H. Ridder, Jr.</p>

	</blockquote>
	<p>Anonymous Viking, ca. 1000 AD</p>

	<strong>Team Name</strong>
	<p>The Minneapolis Tribune reported the franchise planned to be known as Minnesota in the standings of the league and early nicknames suggested were Miners, Vikings, Chippewas and Voyageurs. The nickname Vikings, which was selected because it represented an aggressive person with the will to win and the Nordic tradition in the northern Midwest, was announced at a "Welcome Professional Football" luncheon on Sept. 27, 1960.</p>
